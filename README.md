This is a technical presentation about NQCDynamics.jl I gave in a group meeting in June 2024. Since this info might be useful for anyone getting into NQCD, I've made it public. 

Outline: 

- Brief overview of the different packages in the NQCD Github organisation and what they do.
- A very quick explanation of how to run an MD simulation in NQCDynamics and how the package interacts with the SciML ecosystem along the way.
- More detailed look into each package and what functionality it contains.
- Development tips for anyone looking to implement new features.
